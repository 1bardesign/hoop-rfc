$SOFTWARE is made available under the HOOP License - Help Out, Or Pay.

Copyright $AUTHOR <$EMAIL> $YEAR.

Software provided as-is; no warranty.

This is an agreement between you (either as a personal individual or as a corporation, organization, or other entity on behalf of which you are permitted to accept such agreements) and the Maintainers (the individuals and/or organizations listed above after "Copyright"). Unless you have a separate agreement with the Maintainers granting additional use, you may only use, modify, share, or otherwise take advantage of the software in the ways described below.

Available without charge for the following purposes:

- Non-commercial use; where there is either no further distribution, or there is public distribution with no financial benefit.
- Educational use; within an educational institution such as a school or university, or the home, for the purposes of teaching or learning.
- Contribution to the software.
- Contribution to freely available software to interoperate with the software.
- Commercial use within or for the benefit exclusively of small entities. Small entities are considered any company or person with turnover or personal income not exceeding $200,000 AUD per year, before any relevant taxes are applied.
- Evaluation for commercial use, limited to a single 30 day period.

With the following conditions:

- This license text in its entirety must be included with any distribution of the software, in a way that is easily viewed by the user. The following examples satisfy this condition:
	- Within the user interface of the software, via an appropriate "about" or "software licenses" menu.
	- Within a readme or manual file intended for user consumption.
	- As a plain text file named "$SOFTWARE-license.txt" alongside the distribution (maximum one directory deep, not buried).
- The type of use claimed must be indicated in plain english language, directly before or after the included license text, with any distribution of the software.
	- "$SOFTWARE is used freely as part of (your software) for non-commercial use."
- Free use under this license may continue indefinitely for released projects that remain based on the same version of the software, including for commercial projects where the related entities turnover or income begins to exceed the small entity threshold. A commercial license should be sought before updating the software.
- Free use within other projects does not confer the right to issue a commercial license.

For any other use, a commercial license is required, and should be separately negotiated with the Maintainers listed above via email.

The following expectations generally apply to commercial licenses for HOOP software:

- "Help Out" - a commercial license may be negotiated in exhange for significant contribution to the software.
- "Or Pay" - licensing fees will be proportional to the scope of the use within the project, the purpose of the project, and the nature of the entity seeking a license.
- Licenses can be per-project (perpetual), or organisation-wide (periodic).
- Licensing covers all public and any directly disclosed updates to the software, for the duration of the license.
- The license visibility requirements from the free use conditions still apply.
- Commercial licenses will be publicly disclosed - disclosure can be deferred until after project release if required for per-project licenses, not for organisational licenses.
- Fees may be deferred to the time of publicly shipping a small project.
- Licensing fees will be utilised to fund the continued development of the software and other free software.
- A commercial license may be granted freely at the sole discretion of the Maintainers.

When in doubt about your specific case, ask.
